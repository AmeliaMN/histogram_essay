		<p>When thinking about data, it is often useful to produce plots of variables in one- and two-dimensions (a process which is often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</a>, or EDA.) In this essay, we will be focusing on plots of variables in one dimension.</p>

		<p>When a variable is <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="(Meaning it only has a few possible discrete values)">categorical</a>, the way to view the distribution of one variable is a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/skillswise/factsheet/ma37grap-e3-f-reading-bar-charts">bar chart</a> (also known as a bar graph). Bar charts show how many items are counted in each of a set of categories. For example, fivethirtyeight used a bar chart to show <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-people-are-too-superstitious-to-have-a-baby-on-friday-the-13th/">how many babies are born on the 13th of the month</a>, broken down by day of the week.</p>

		<p>Most common first names, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-the-most-common-name-in-america/">fivethirtyeight article</a></p>

		<p>Days of the week are discrete choices, so Carl Bialik (the author of the chart) counted up how much higher or lower than average the number of births was for each category. </p>

		<p>Bar charts are nice because they are not parameterized. That is, there aren't many choices for the data analyst to make when creating a bar chart. As we will see, this is not the case for histograms.</p>

<p>Histograms are a common form of graphic display that have been around for more than one hundred years. They can be used in many contexts, including database systems.</p>

		<p>Most tools for working with data provide functionality to generate histograms, but most of them abstract away the defaults baked into the system. As a result, it is easy to come away with the belief that the histogram you generated is representative of the data you used, when in fact it is only one of a great number of possible histograms. </p>

		<p>Both of us (Aran Lunzer and Amelia McNamara) are interested in making it easier to see these types of choices. Lunzer's work focuses on "subjunctive interfaces," those that show you what <em>else</em> you might have seem, while McNamara is primarily interested in the effects of parameter choices on statistical visualizations.</p>

		  <p>Histograms are a way to summarize numeric data. Since they are about one variable but are two-dimensional, they can sometimes be hard to understand.</p>

		<p>To begin, let's consider some data about calories in cereal. If we wanted to see the distribution of calories, we could plot the data on a number line.
		</p>
		<a class="thumbnail"><img src="img/numberline.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Numberline"/></a>
		
		<p>But, what if you had a second cereal with 70 calories? Where would you put it? It makes sense to stack those points on top of one another. </p>
		<a class="thumbnail"><img src="img/numberline2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Numberline"/></a>

		<p>There's also a problem of space. What if the range of your data was larger?</p>

		<p>We might want to zoom in so it was easier to read the labels. But, how do we decide where to put the points?</p>
		<a class="thumbnail"><img src="img/numberline4.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Numberline"/></a>
		<p> We want to place the points where they would fall on the line, which might require binning.</p>

		<p>There's a problem with deciding the bin edge boundary rules. To make these decisions, we need <b>interval notation</b>.</p>
		<p>This interval includes 60.000001 but not 60. It inclues 70 but not 70.00001.</p>
		<a class="thumbnail"><img src="img/bin2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="A bin"/></a>
		<p>This interval would not include either 60 or 70. This doesn't work for evenly-defined bins!</p>

		<a class="thumbnail"><img src="img/weirdintervals.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Weird bins"/></a>
		<p>In R, histograms are by default left open</p>

		<pre>
			>hist(Cereal$Calories)</pre>
		<p>But it's just as valid to switch to right open</p>
		<pre>
			>hist(Cereal$Calories, right=FALSE)</pre>
			<p>Okay, so we've thought a lot about plotting points on the number line. But what if we have too many points to easily display?</p>

		<a class="thumbnail"><img src="img/histogram2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Histogram"/></a>
		<p>No matter which binwidths we choose, we're trying to answer the question "what is the distribution of this data like?" This is like trying to explain the distribution to someone over the phone. I could read the entire list of data and you could see exactly what the values were, but you're probably more interested in knowing that it is symmetric, centered around 80, and with some extreme values on the right. How consistent is this description when we vary the binwidth parameter?</p>

		<p>"Stretchy histograms" (those allowing users to adjust the binwidth dynamically) are available in a variety of commercially-available systems. In his 1997 paper, "Software for Learning and Doing Statistics," Rolf Biehler talks about this feature in his software Statistics Workshop. Similar abilities were included in DataDesk, Fathom, and TinkerPlots. However, many professional tools eschewed stretchy histograms (or even left histograms out altogether!). Excel can be extended to create histograms by the installation of a third-party add-on. Expert R users can create stretchy histograms using Shiny or manipulate, but even these do not offer direct manipulation, instead waiting for the user to drop a slider before updating the view.  </p>

		<p>There are many algorithms for automatically choosing the number of bins in a histogram or the width of histogram bins. The Sturges algorithm is a well-known method for choosing bin widths, but other algorithms include Scott's choice and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman%E2%80%93Diaconis_rule">Freedman-Diaconis choice</a>. M. P. Wand proposed a new algorithm in 1997.  </p>

		<p>"The order in which graph types are introduced is likely to reflect the complexity associated understanding the basic elements as other related aspects of mathematics are developing. Conservation of number and counting are clearly prerequisites for work with graphing, although early graphs can be used for reinforcement of counting and comparison skills. Categorical attributes, such as colors or fruit types, are likely to be understood before measurement attributes, for example, measuring with rulers. The related complexity of the scales for axes suggests an ordering such as categories (e.g., red, blue, green, ...), followed by whole number markings for ``stacking dots,'' then scales with markings in fractions or decimals between whole number values. Later interval scales associated with histograms may be quite variable and hence more complex." - Jane Watson and Noleine Fitzallen </p>
