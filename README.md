## This repository contains the code powering [Exploring Histograms](http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/), an interactive essay by [Aran Lunzer](http://bit.ly/aranlunzer) and [Amelia McNamara](https://www.amelia.mn).

If you came here from the essay, you are probably most interested in the code located in the `scripts` directory. `scripts` contains the file `chartObject.js`, which powers the visualization in the essay. Also in that directory is `scrollSteps.js` to support the scrollytelling behavior. The datasets we use in the essay are in the `data` directory.

The rest of the repository may eventually be cleaned up.
